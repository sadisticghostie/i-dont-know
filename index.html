        </h1>When I first met you, I didn't like you tbh, you were stealing my friends and I had no one to play with, my boredom shrouded my head and the world became bleak. But we talked, I gained a bit of liking to you, you make me laugh, you impress me and most of all, you make me confused... What's the deal with you? Why can't I read you I said, the more I uncover about your story the more drawn I am to listen, I never knew I fell for you and I was okay with it. But it didn't last, I lost you and I had no hope, the world became bleak again and sorrow I felt. But today as your here, you spoke our promises and I'm happy you remembered, you saved me again from the bleakness of this world. And I want to save you from the people here. You are beautiful yet strong, funny and serious, you make me laugh, sad, angry and jealoused... Sometimes. I want to be yours Alex, and i want you, make stories together, dance you under the tower, kiss you under the cover, hug you tight with my arms, protect you and cause havoc together. Can I ask a question?<h1>
